# Day 2 DSA Problems

On **Day 2**, we focused on solving **3 important problems** to strengthen our DSA concepts.  

## What we did:

1. **Longest Subarray Sum = K**  
   - Learned how to find the **longest contiguous subarray** whose sum equals K.  
   - Used **Prefix Sum + HashMap** to handle negative numbers.  
   - Practiced understanding how running sums and storing first occurrence helps find the longest subarray.

2. **Count of Subarrays with Sum = K**  
   - Learned to **count all subarrays** whose sum equals K.  
   - Used **Prefix Sum + HashMap** differently — this time storing **frequency** of sums.  
   - Saw the difference between counting subarrays vs finding longest subarray.

3. **Product of Array Except Self**  
   - Learned to calculate **product of all elements except the current one** without using division.  
   - Used **prefix products + suffix products**.  
   - Practiced thinking about **arrays from both left and right directions**.

## Key Takeaways:
- Learned **Prefix Sum + HashMap pattern** for subarray problems.  
- Practiced handling **negative numbers** in subarrays.  
- Learned **prefix & suffix trick** for array product problems.  
- Day 2 strengthened **problem-solving skills** and **pattern recognition** for interviews.
