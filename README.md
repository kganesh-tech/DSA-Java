DAY-1: Arrays

**Introduction: **
 I am K.Ganesh pursuing my B-TECH from Marwadi University and as part of my self-learning plan, I decided to improve my "Data structures & Algorithms" skills systematically.
  The goal is to ** solve 3 problems every day ** and upload them on Github to track progress and build a strong portfolio. This approach also helps me "practice coding professionally",
  learn multiple problem-solving techniques, and prepare for **interviews at top tech companies**.

This folder contains the solutions for **Day-1** problems focused on **Arrays**.

## Problems Solved

1. Move.Zeroes.java
2.BestTimeToBuySellStock.java
3.MajorityElement.java

## Approaches used

--**Move Zeroes**: Two pointers / overwrite non-zero elements, fill remaining with zero.
--**Best Time To Buy and Sell Stock** :Track minimum price, calculate max profit.
--**Majority Element** : Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.

## How to Run

1. Open each ".java" file in a Java IDE or Java online compiler
2. Run the 'main()' method.

3. Output will be printed in the console
