# Day 3 DSA Problems

On **Day 3**, we focused on **Sliding Window + Hashing** problems to strengthen our problem-solving and array/string manipulation skills.

## Problems Solved:

1. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
   - Learned how to find the **length of the longest substring** where no character repeats.
   - Used **sliding window + HashSet**.
   - Practiced expanding and shrinking the window to maintain uniqueness.

2. **Find Duplicate Number**
   - Learned how to find the **duplicate number** in an array efficiently.
   - Used **HashSet** to track seen numbers.
   - Practiced using hashing to detect duplicates in O(n) time.

3. **Longest Consecutive Sequence**
   - Learned how to find the **length of the longest consecutive numbers** in an unsorted array.
   - Used **HashSet** for O(1) lookup.
   - Practiced recognizing the start of a sequence and counting consecutive numbers efficiently.

## Key Takeaways:
- Sliding window technique is very effective for **substring and subarray problems**.
- Hashing helps detect **duplicates** and track sequences in **O(n) time**.
- Day 3 strengthened skills in **arrays, strings, and hash-based algorithms**.
